# Syntax diagrams

Visual railroad diagrams showing exactly what DomainLang syntax is valid.

## What are these diagrams?

These **railroad diagrams** (also called syntax diagrams) are a visual way to understand the grammar rules of DomainLang. They show every valid way to write each construct in the language.

### How to read them

Follow the arrows from left to right. When paths split, you can take any branch. Loops mean you can repeat that element.

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Blue boxes** | References to other rules (click to navigate) |
| **Rounded paths** | Literal keywords or tokens to type |
| **Split paths** | Choose one option |
| **Loop arrows** | Repeat zero or more times |

### When to use them

- **Resolving syntax questions** — "Can I put `description` before `vision`?" Follow the diagram to find out
- **Understanding optional vs required** — Paths that can be skipped are optional; single paths are required
- **Learning advanced syntax** — Discover features you might not know exist
- **Language implementers** — If you're building tooling for DomainLang

::: tip
For most users, the [Language Reference](/reference/language) and [Quick Reference](/reference/quick-reference) are easier to use. These diagrams are the authoritative technical specification.

### About railroad diagrams

[Railroad diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) (or syntax diagrams) are a standard way to visualize context-free grammars. They were popularized by the Pascal User Manual and are used by many language specifications including [JSON](https://www.json.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/syntaxdiagrams.html).

::: info Generated by Langium
These diagrams are automatically generated from DomainLang's grammar definition using [Langium](https://langium.org/)'s railroad diagram generator. They always reflect the current language syntax.
